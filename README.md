# Promenadologie: Dynamic Maps for Soundscape Composition

This repository contains code for **Promenadologie**, a browser-based interface for exploring geo-tagged field recordings as presented on the [Dimmi 2024 conference](https://event.unitn.it/dimmi2024/)

Inspired by soundscape composition and the concept of d√©rive, we explored a alternative way to enjoy field recordings.
